## MyLangProject
This project was created to be a fun way of learning Chinese (Mandrain) for my daughter who is a non-native speaker.

As I also don't know how to read/write/speak Chinese, it was a good problem statement to solve at home :)

So the requirements came from my daughter, I designed some basic (but workable) UI and got approval from her.

I was able to help her listen to text she received in homework and get the meaning of the words.
